Introduction

Cyber security is an ever evolving lands where malicious actors are always attempting to exploit and gain access to sensitive and vital systems in order to cause damage, stealing data, and disrupting operations. To combat these threats, a comprehensive approach to information security governance & regulation is necessary.This approach requires establishing very detailed policies and guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organisations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches.

Learning Objectives 

*Understand what GRC is and the importance of governance and regulation in cyber security.
*Understanding the Governance Risk & Compliance framework. 
*Develop & raise own cyber security posture as per international standards, including ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and many more.

Important Terms

Governance- In governance, we are guiding an organization or some type of system to achieve its objectives while also complying with laws, regulations and standards.
Regulation- This is a rule or law enforced by a governing body to make sure compliance it met and to protect from harm. 
Compliance-This is to adhere to all laws and regulations that apply to an organization or system.

Information Security Governance 

Information security governance is the organization's established structure, policies, methods and guidelines. This also includes accessibility to information assets. The complexity of cyber threats has grown exponentially, so the importance of governence is ever more important. There are five processes to information security governance.

*Strategy-Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives.
*Policies and procedures-Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
*Risk management-Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
*Performance measurement- Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
*Compliance-Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

Information Security Regulation

Information security regulation refers to the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets. These regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft and misuse. The most important regulations that we want to remember are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act(PIPEDA),Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act(GLBA) and the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act(HIPPA). 

Note: To summarize, all of these regulation are EXTREMELY common and must be learned and adhered to if any organization is to conduct operations legaly.
Note: The GLBA is a European based regulation.

Information Security Frameworks

Information security frameworks provides an in-dept set of documents that outline an organization's approach to security and governs how it is implemented, managed, and enforced. This includes the following:

*Policies: A formal statement that outlines an organisation's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives.
*Standards: A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service.
*Guidelines: A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives.
*Procedures: Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process.
*Baselines: A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet.

Documentation 

Documentation is a very important process in GRC and should never be overlooked. It outlines all of the policies and procedures that must be taken in order for standards to be upheld. For example, every organization should have password policy documentation. This is an example of preparing a password policy from the lab. 

*Define password requirements: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
*Define password usage guidelines: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords.
*Define password storage and transmission guidelines: Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission.
*Define password change and reset guidelines: How often passwords should be changed etc. 
*Communicate the policy: Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy.
*Monitor compliance: Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

There are even documentation for incident response procedures. This really shows how robust documentation must be in order to adhere to all of the laws and regulations in order to continue and thrive as a business. For my knowledge, I will also include the incident reponse procedures as well since it will be vital practice for the future.

*Define incident types: Unauthorised access, malware infections, or data breaches.
*Define incident response roles and responsibilities: Identify the stakeholders,  such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management.
*Detailed Steps: Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident,  including initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations.
*Report the incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference.
*Communicate the incident response procedures.
*Review and update the incident response procedures.

Note: Even with all of the documentation in the lab, we do not need to adhere to every single regulation. It will heavily depend on the industry you work. A great example is myself, since I work in the insurance/healthcare insdustry, HIPPA is very prevelant.

Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)

We already know that GRC is neccesary to maintain the security posture of an organization, but how exactly do achieve this loafty goal? This is where the GRC framework comes into play! This framework focuses on  steering the organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner. GRC has three major components.

*Governance Component: Involves guiding an organisation by setting its direction through information security strategy,  which includes policies, standards, baselines, frameworks, etc., along with establishing appropriate monitoring methods to measure its performance and assess the outcomes.
*Risk Management Component: Involves identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigation strategies to manage those risks effectively. This includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuously evaluating and refining the risk management program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness.
*Compliance Component: Ensuring that the organisation meets its legal, regulatory, and industry obligations and that its activities align with its policies and procedures. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducting regular audits and assessments, and reporting on compliance issues to stakeholders.

There are also generic guidelines in the lab that outline best practices and how to improve your security posture.

*Define the scope and objectives: This step involves determining the scope of the GRC program and defining its goals. For example, a company can implement a GRC program for its customer data management system. The objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months while maintaining the trust of its customers. 
*Conduct a risk assessment: In this step, the organisation identifies and assesses its cyber risks. For example, a risk assessment might reveal that the customer data management system is vulnerable to external attacks due to weak access controls or outdated software. The organisation can then prioritize these risks and develop a risk management strategy.
*Develope policies and procedures: Policies and procedures are developed to guide cyber security practices within the organisation. For example, the company might establish a password policy to ensure the usage of strong passwords. They might also implement logging and monitoring system access procedures to detect suspicious activity.
*Establish governance processes: Governance processes ensure the GRC program is effectively managed and controlled. For example, the organisation might establish a security steering committee that meets regularly to review security risks and make decisions about security investments and priorities. Roles and responsibilities are defined to ensure everyone understands their role in the program.
*Implement controls: Technical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks identified in risk assessment. For example, the company might implement firewalls, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to prevent external attacks and impart employee training to improve security awareness and reduce the risk of human error.
Note: Splunk, AlienVault, IBM QRadar
*Monitor and measure performance: Processes are established to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the GRC program. For example, the organisation can track metrics and compliance with security policies. This information is used to identify areas for improvement and adjust the program as needed.
*Continuously improve: The GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles, and stakeholder feedback. For example, suppose the organisation experiences a security incident. In that case, it might conduct a post-incident analysis to identify the root cause and make changes to prevent a similar incident from happening again.

NIST 800-53

NIST 800-53 is a publication titled "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organisations". It was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) and essentially gives the organization a catalogue of controls that protect the holy trinity of security, or the Confidentiality, Integrity and Accessibility(CIA) triad. This framework helps organizations assess and enhance the security and privacy of their information systems in accordance to various laws and regulations. It includes security controls within 20 families. The most important family amongst them is the Program Managemtn family. This is a incredibly crucial control that mandates establishing, implementing, and monitoring organisation-wide programs for information security and privacy while safeguarding the processed, stored, or transmitted through systems.

Note: As of writing this, NIST 800-53 Rev5 is the latest version. 

ISO/IEC 27001

ISO 27001 is a standard for requirements to plan,develope,run and update and organization's Information Security Management System(ISMS).It was developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and has the following core components:

*Scope: This specifies the ISMS's boundaries, including the covered assets and processes.
*Information security policy: A high-level document defining an organisation's information security approach.
*Risk assessment: Involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation's information.
*Risk treatment: Involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level.
*Statement of Applicability (SoA): This document specifies which controls from the standard are applicable and which are not.
*Internal audit: This involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively.
*Management review: Review the performance of ISMS at regular intervals.

Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2)
SOC 2  was developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as a framework for compliance and auditing. It focuses mainly on assesing the efficacy of a company's data and security based on the CIA triad.SOC 2 also serves to reassure customers, stakeholders and business partners that the company has suffient controls in place to safeguard it's systems, data and sensitive information. The framework is crucial for service providers who interact with client data and provides solutions that process,store, or transmit sensitive data.

Note: When you hear about SOC 2, you will mostly pair it with SOC2 reports.

Conclusion

In conclusion, cyber security is constantly changing, and it's crucial to stay ahead of malicious actors trying to exploit systems. By understanding the importance of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) in cyber security, organizations can create strong policies, monitor effectively, and comply with standards like ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53. This proactive approach helps protect sensitive systems and prevent serious breaches.
