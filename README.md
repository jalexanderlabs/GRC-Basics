Introduction

Cyber security is an ever evolving lands where malicious actors are always attempting to exploit and gain access to sensitive and vital systems in order to cause damage, stealing data, and disrupting operations. To combat these threats, a comprehensive approach to information security governance & regulation is necessary.This approach requires establishing very detailed policies and guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organisations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches.

Learning Objectives 

*Understand what GRC is and the importance of governance and regulation in cyber security.
*Understanding the Governance Risk & Compliance framework. 
*Develop & raise own cyber security posture as per international standards, including ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and many more.

Important Terms

Governance- In governance, we are guiding an organization or some type of system to achieve its objectives while also complying with laws, regulations and standards.
Regulation- This is a rule or law enforced by a governing body to make sure compliance it met and to protect from harm. 
Compliance-This is to adhere to all laws and regulations that apply to an organization or system.

Information Security Governance 

Information security governance is the organization's established structure, policies, methods and guidelines. This also includes accessibility to information assets. The complexity of cyber threats has grown exponentially, so the importance of governence is ever more important. There are five processes to information security governance.

*Strategy-Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives.
*Policies and procedures-Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
*Risk management-Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
*Performance measurement- Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
*Compliance-Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

Information Security Regulation

Information security regulation refers to the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets. These regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft and misuse. The most important regulations that we want to remember are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act(PIPEDA),Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act(GLBA) and the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act(HIPPA). 

Note: To summarize, all of these regulation are EXTREMELY common and must be learned and adhered to if any organization is to conduct operations legaly.
Note: The GLBA is a European based regulation.
